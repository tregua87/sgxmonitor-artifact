a minute to learn - hours to play

Biniax-2 is a game of logic and reaction. The 3
game modes allow you to play against the time,
pure tactical play or challenge with a friend
in a multiplayer game.
Biniax series are also child-friendly games
no kills, no violence, no weapons.

yer, "space" key (or tap the broom, when touch-

==============
 :GAME RULES:
==============
Biniax-2 implements mainly the rules of the ori-
ginal Biniax game :
The player moves a single element around a field
of pairs of elements. You can take a pair if it 
contains your element. When a pair is taken, pla-
yer's element becomes the other element of the
taken pair. Sometimes the field is scrolling down
(the scrolling elements can push you down)
and the goal of the game is to stay as long as
possible on the board.

==============
 :GAME MODES:
==============
== ARCADE GAME ==
In the arcade-logic mode, the scrolling happens
in a time period, which decreases with the game
progress. It is almost the original Biniax 
gameplay, but introduces also obstacles and
column clearing. The available clearings are
shown at the right side of the screen.

== TACTIC GAME ==
When you play tactic game, the time has no
effect. The field goes down after you spend your
moves (move counter is situated at the right 
side of the gaming field). The allowed moves de-
pend the field situation (when there are obsta-
cles, the allowed moves are more). The available
clearings are shown at the right-bottom side of
the screen.

== MULTIPLAYER ==
In multiplayer mode you can challenge your fri-
ends in an arcade-logic game. The winner is the
player, who remains longer in the field.

== CONTINUE LAST GAME ==
When the player exits a singleplayer game, it
is automatically saved. Using the continue
menu option, you can resume your last game.
